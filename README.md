# SDE API Round - IRCTC

This is a railway management system built with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It provides APIs for users to check train availability, book seats, and manage bookings. It also includes an admin interface for creating and managing trains.

By using transactions and row-level locking, I ensure that only one user can book the available seats at a given time.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Train creation and management (admin only)
- Check train availability between source and destination
- Book seats on available trains (handled race conditions)
- View booking details

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- bcrypt.js

## Installation

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file and set the following environment variables:
   - `HOST`: MySQL database host
   - `USER`: MySQL database user
   - `PASSWORD`: MySQL database password
   - `NAME`: MySQL database name
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation
   - `ADMIN_KEY`: Admin key for protected routes
3. Create the MySQL database and tables by running the SQL scripts in the `database` directory.
4. Start the server: `npm start`
